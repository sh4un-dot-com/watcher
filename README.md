# ESP32-C3 LD2410C Presence Sensor for Home Assistant

![Project Image](images/project_image.jpg)

## Overview

This project implements a presence sensor using the ESP32-C3 microcontroller and the LD2410C sensor. The sensor detects the presence of people and communicates this information to Home Assistant via MQTT. The project is designed for home automation applications, providing a reliable way to detect occupancy in specific areas.

## Features

- LD2410C sensor-based presence detection.
- Integration with Home Assistant for occupancy monitoring.
- MQTT communication for seamless integration into smart home ecosystems.
